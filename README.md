# **Kang Saebyeok <3**

_read the synopsis and view the characters [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game) :)_

Kang Saebyeok is a North Korean defector who came to the South with her little brother. Her father died while crossing over to South Korea, and her Mother was captured in China, taken back to the North. Saebyeok needs a large sum of money in order to bring her mother back to her family, so she resorts to pickpocketing random people on the streets. However, she gets an offer to get an excessive sum of money if she participates in a series of 6 games, and wins.

## **#067**

Sabyeok is player number 67 throughout the film, and she is portrayed as an independent female who works (and steals) for her family to live happily together.

She eventually joins the group of the main lead, and also meets another girl called Ji-yeong, who killed her father for revenge for her mother, and goes to jail. When she comes out, she has nowhere else to go, so she enters the game. They become close over a long talk during one of the games where they are set up to kill each other, and Ji-yeong gives her life for Saebyeok to go on with her life and live with her family.

**!SPOILER!**

Saebyeok eventually dies in her bed right before the start of the last game to the hands of Sang Hwan. He stabs her while she is wounded already from the previous game, and the masked beings come in to take her away, to ultimately burn her body away. 

The drama ended with an open ending, so hopefully _Squid Game_ pulls a _Penthouse_ and Saebyeok comes back to life.
